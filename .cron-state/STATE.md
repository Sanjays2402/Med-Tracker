# Med-Tracker autoship state

Branch: `feature/autoship` (off `main`)

This file is Cake (cron)'s only persistent memory between 20-min ticks. Update at
the end of every tick.

## Conventions

- Each tick ships up to 5 vertical feature slices, one commit per slice.
- Commit identity: Cake (cron) <51058514+Sanjays2402@users.noreply.github.com>
- No emoji in commit messages.
- Each new utility lives in `packages/utils/src/<feature>.ts`, tests in
  `packages/utils/tests/<feature>.test.ts`, and is re-exported from
  `packages/utils/src/index.ts`.
- Run the full quality gate ONCE per tick: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build`.

## Repo state notes (read first)

- **pnpm store is on `/Volumes/Projects/.pnpm-store`** (config set explicitly
  because the root volume `/` was at 100%). Do not change.
- **node_modules is on `/Volumes/Projects/Med-Tracker/node_modules`** (the
  project volume); a fresh `pnpm install --prefer-offline --ignore-scripts`
  on tick 1 took ~11 minutes due to network re-downloads. Subsequent ticks
  should hit the store and be near-instant.
- **Pre-existing baseline failures on `main` (NOT to be blamed on autoship
  ticks; reproduced by running typecheck on main directly):**
  - `@med/config` typecheck: missing `@types/node` (4 errors in `src/index.ts`).
  - `@med/db` typecheck: missing `@types/node` + Prisma client type drift
    (Prisma 7 removed the `PrismaClient` / `Prisma` named exports the code
    depends on; 14 errors across `src/client.ts` + `src/seed.ts`).
  - `@med/utils` typecheck: ~18 errors in `src/taper-plan.ts` +
    `src/titration.ts` (strict undefined narrowing not satisfied; predates
    autoship).
  - `@med/ui` test suite: 228/228 fail with "ReferenceError: React is not
    defined" (the components were authored before the React 17+ automatic
    JSX runtime was enforced; missing `vitest.config.ts` jsx settings, or
    needs explicit `import React`).
  - Many `@med/web` tsx imports referencing missing local files.
- Autoship features must pass their own typecheck + tests in isolation
  (verified per tick via `pnpm --filter @med/utils test` and tsc on the
  new files).
- Do NOT push red code that you yourself introduced. If the existing
  baseline gates fail through no fault of the tick, ship anyway and log
  it here.

### Tier 2 — UI / app slices (web + ui pkg)

(Pulled forward only after Tier 1 momentum is established. Note: the
`@med/ui` test suite is currently red on baseline — fix the React JSX
runtime issue before adding UI features so new components don't get
buried under pre-existing failures.)

## Tick log

- 2026-06-20 01:42 PDT — tick 1: bootstrap + 5 features shipped.
  Commits: c571a7f renewal-window, 017535d missed-dose-replan,
  4f6e2df dose-rounding, 19d5df9 streak-rescue, 6e174b1 pharmacy-hours.
  Gate: 305/305 tests pass in `@med/utils` (49 new + 256 existing);
  full `pnpm typecheck` fails on pre-existing `@med/config`, `@med/db`,
  `@med/ui`, `@med/utils/titration.ts` errors that reproduce on main
  with no autoship changes applied.

- 2026-06-20 05:13 PDT — tick 2: 5 features shipped.
  Commits: 8facf2b notification-batcher, 67a446b dose-history-aggregator,
  439ca7b bp-log, 14b59ba glucose-log, 966a513 prn-budget.
  Gate: 368/368 tests pass in `@med/utils` (63 new + 305 existing);
  `@med/utils typecheck` baseline = 43 errors identical to origin/main,
  zero new errors introduced by tick 2 (verified by checking out
  `origin/main` packages/utils and recounting). Lint + build remain
  placeholder echo in this package.

  Notes:
  - Both `bp-log` and `glucose-log` exported `SummaryOptions`; renamed
    to `BpSummaryOptions` and `GlucoseSummaryOptions` to keep
    `export *` re-exports unambiguous. Future tickets adding more
    summary utilities should follow the `<Module>SummaryOptions`
    pattern.
  - Test dates: avoid `new Date('YYYY-MM-DD')` which parses as UTC
    midnight; on PDT it lands on the prior local day and breaks the
    aggregator's local-time bucketing. Use `new Date(2026, 5, 15)`
    (Y, monthIndex, day) instead. Documented in
    `tests/dose-history-aggregator.test.ts`.

- 2026-06-20 08:17 PDT — tick 3: 5 features shipped.
  Commits: 3ade8e7 weight-trend, 9b929d0 dose-streak-by-med,
  580dedd pill-burden, d242169 pharmacy-distance-pick,
  044406f dose-adherence-trend.
  Gate: 448/448 tests pass in `@med/utils` (80 new this tick: 16+12+19+17+16);
  full `pnpm -r test` shows `@med/ui` 228/228 failures unchanged from
  baseline (React JSX runtime missing — confirmed reproduces on
  origin/main by re-running tests with main's `packages/utils` checked
  out). `@med/utils typecheck` baseline still 43 errors, all in
  pre-existing files (titration, taper-plan, schedule-resolver,
  adherence-risk, ics, date) — zero new errors from tick 3.

  Notes:
  - `weight-trend` MAD outlier detection needed a fallback: pure MAD
    is zero on a near-constant window, so a single outlier scored 0
    deviation. Falls back to `mean(nonZeroDeviations) / 8` so a 72 ->
    200 spike trips the `>= madFactor * scale` threshold. Future
    summarizers with similar "robust scale on near-constant data"
    needs should consider the same fallback.
  - `pill-burden` uses a small `parseStrength` helper (exported) to
    coerce "500 mg" / "5 mL" / "100 mcg" / "0.5 g" into canonical
    units. Reusable for other modules needing strength parsing.
  - `pharmacy-distance-pick` composes with `pharmacy-hours.ts` and
    introduces a clean `haversineDistanceKm` (exported) for
    distance math elsewhere (refill-batching could weight by it).
  - `dose-adherence-trend` composes directly with
    `dose-history-aggregator.ts` — pass a `DoseAggregation` straight
    in. r2 floor (`minR2: 0.1` default) prevents bouncing series
    from producing false trends. Useful precedent: future
    "trend" utilities should expose both a slope AND an r2-based
    confidence gate.

- 2026-06-20 13:42 PDT — tick 4: 5 features shipped + 1 fixup.
  Commits: 6adaa92 regimen-summary, 33f69ff interaction-pair-search,
  4d333c4 reminder-snooze-policy, 9fff87d vacation-overrides,
  6274a75 medication-history-import, 2e5511d fix (rename
  regimen-summary's TimeBucket to RegimenTimeBucket to resolve
  re-export collision with pill-burden).
  Gate: 542/542 tests pass in `@med/utils` (94 new this tick:
  16+22+17+17+22). Lint + build placeholder ok. `@med/utils`
  typecheck baseline = 43 errors identical to origin/main; zero
  new errors introduced by tick 4 (verified by grep of tsc output
  against the 5 new module file names — no hits). No other
  package imports the new modules so `@med/ui` baseline
  failures (228/228 JSX runtime) are unaffected.

  Notes:
  - `pill-burden` already exports `TimeBucket` (4 buckets:
    morning/midday/evening/bedtime). `regimen-summary` needed a
    different 5-bucket set (adds explicit `afternoon` and
    `overnight`) and the two are semantically different windows,
    so renamed `regimen-summary`'s type to `RegimenTimeBucket`
    rather than collapsing them. Future modules with a "time of
    day" bucket type should add a module-prefixed name to avoid
    re-export collisions; the `@med/utils` index re-exports
    everything with `export *` so name clashes break typecheck.
  - `medication-history-import` initially used a round-to-bucket
    dedup key on the timestamp, which produced false negatives
    at bucket boundaries (08:04 -> bucket 0, 08:06 -> bucket 10
    with 5-min tolerance both miss each other). Switched to a
    per-med list of `{ ms, index }` with abs-diff <= tolerance
    check. Slightly slower (O(rows-per-med)) but exact at the
    boundary; for human-scale histories the cost is invisible.
  - `interaction-pair-search` composes with `interaction-severity`
    by calling `classifyInteractions` once at index time, plus
    on-demand 2-drug runs for candidates outside the active list.
    Cache hits are written so a repeat query is O(1). Stays in
    lockstep with SEVERITY_RULES — no duplicate rules.
  - `vacation-overrides` operates on `DoseInstance[]` (a small
    `{ medicationId, dueAt: Date }` tuple) so it composes with
    `expandSchedule` output without dragging the full Dose Zod
    type through. Per-med overrides win over regimen-wide ones
    for the same date; that lets a "fasting day" skip everything
    except a critical seizure med via a more-specific override.
  - `reminder-snooze-policy` exposes a `snoozeLadder()` preview
    helper so the settings UI can show "5, 10, 20 minutes" for
    the user's chosen factor/cap. Total-elapsed `autoSkipAfterMinutes`
    is a belt-and-braces cap independent of snooze count.

- 2026-06-20 16:27 PDT — tick 5: 5 features shipped.
  Commits: 700a65f dose-time-drift, 7e54a51 regimen-change-diff,
  fd20e05 caregiver-permission-matrix, f3fa325 insurance-tier-pick,
  02d181f caregiver-summary-rollup.
  Gate: 624/624 tests pass in `@med/utils` (82 new this tick:
  15+16+20+15+16). Lint + build placeholder ok. `@med/utils`
  typecheck baseline = 43 errors identical to origin/main; zero
  new errors introduced by tick 5 (verified by listing the unique
  error files: taper-plan, titration, schedule-resolver,
  adherence-risk, date, ics — none of the 5 new tick-5 modules
  appear). `@med/ui` 228/228 JSX runtime failures unchanged from
  baseline.

  Notes:
  - `dose-time-drift` filters by medicationId at the per-med
    entrypoint AND in the multi-med entrypoint groups before
    calling computeDoseTimeDrift; reports are sorted by confidence
    descending so the UI surfaces actionable rows first. Noise
    clipping (default 240 min) keeps the median robust without
    discarding the sample (count is preserved). When sample size
    is below minSamples, direction='insufficient' and message
    cites the actual count.
  - `regimen-change-diff` normalizes schedules through a sorted-
    key (sorted times, sorted daysOfWeek, kind, interval, cron,
    enabled) so reordered times do NOT register as a change. A
    kind change (daily -> interval) shows up as both a
    schedules-removed and schedules-added diff entry, which the
    UI bullet renderer surfaces clearly. The `fields` allow-list
    lets callers restrict to a subset when only certain fields
    are interesting (e.g. dashboard cares about strength +
    schedules, refill page cares about supply only).
  - `caregiver-permission-matrix` uses deny-wins-over-grant
    semantics so a medication marked deny=['view-medications'] is
    invisible even if the global scope grants view-medications.
    Expired shares return a matrix with expired=true and ALL
    helpers short-circuit to false / empty (no leaking access via
    the per-medication map). Capability vocabulary is explicit:
    no implicit "admin" capability. Scope -> capability map is
    typed against `NonNullable<CaregiverShare['scopes']>[number]`
    so adding a new scope in @med/types is a type error here
    until handled.
  - `insurance-tier-pick` charges fullPriceCents while the
    patient's remaining deductible could cover the full fill,
    falling back to copay once the deductible cannot. This is an
    approximation (an exact tracker would partial-bill the first
    fill); the 'deductible-applies' flag discloses it. Tiebreak
    on equal cost prefers offerings WITHOUT prior-auth /
    step-therapy flags. Mail-order + daysSupply >= 90 produces
    both 'mail-order-discount' and 'ninety-day-pack' flags so
    the UI can compose a "Switch to mail order for $X less"
    nudge.
  - `caregiver-summary-rollup` composes directly with
    composeCaregiverDigest's DigestInput type so callers can
    fan-out a single SQL query into both per-patient emails and
    a combined household summary. Singular/plural is hand-rolled
    (no Intl.PluralRules) so the messages render the same in
    every environment. attentionMedications are sorted by PDC
    ascending and capped at perPatientMissedLimit with an
    "and N more" tail.
